Make a recipe website that has local links to multiple html files etc.
I will have to use links, headers, paragraphs and maybe some strong and em. I might want to have some images too!

After thoughts:
Went well, curriculum learnings from previous lectures was enough!

Learnings:
Dont forget to add .. when referring back to index.html
/index.html works on local machine but not on web
../index.html works on both local and web
